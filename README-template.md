## My process

### Built with

- **HTML5** – for structuring the content
- **CSS3 with custom properties (variables)** – for styling and managing light/dark themes
- **Flexbox & Grid** – to layout the dashboard in a responsive manner
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – to implement the theme toggle and dynamic behaviors
- **Media Queries** – to adapt the layout for mobile and desktop screens
- **Frontend Mentor design files** – followed the provided style guide and assets

### What I learned

- How to use `:root` and CSS variables to manage themes efficiently
- Toggling dark and light mode using JavaScript by modifying root variables
- Responsive design tricks using Flexbox and Grid to create a clean layout for different screen sizes
- Creating theme-based conditional hover effects using `classList` and `:hover`
- Handling SVG and image color manipulations using filters and HSL

### Continued development

- Add smooth transitions when switching between light and dark themes
- Store user preferences in `localStorage` to persist theme across sessions
- Improve accessibility: high contrast mode, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles
- Add animation to the toggle switch for a smoother user experiencec
